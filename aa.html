<p><b><font color="darkgreen">Nature is that natural and physical world that surrounds us and makes life possible on earth</b>. Nature is the heart of earth. Nature heals us and helps build connection with our freedom, authenticity and our souls. Simply connecting and feeling nature gives us a divine pleasure. We have a strong bond and emotional connection with nature.
<i>The serenity of nature calms our hearts</i>. The stillness and movement in nature both have a hypnotizing effect. The unfolding creativity of nature is an art. It is alluring to experience solitude with nature. The practice of devoting ourselves to the bliss of nature is soothing and reviving. Everyone loves to escape away in the mysteries of nature.
<strong>Nature refers to the physical world and all forms of life species on earth in general</strong>. Our natural ecosystem is the community of biotic and abiotic components. The biotic components are the living organisms that also include humans. Abiotic components are the non-living components such as air, water, minerals and soil. The biotic and abiotic components are interrelated and interact with each other through energy flow.
<ins>Natural ecosystem also includes the interrelation between diverse organisms and their environment</ins>. Natural ecosystem obtains energy primarily from sun through photosynthesis. Through the process of photosynthesis plants obtain energy from sunlight and absorb carbon dioxide from atmosphere. Plants combine carbon dioxide and water to produce oxygen and carbohydrates. The energy obtained by plants is consumed by animals. Animals also play important role in nutrient cycle and flow of energy. They influence plants and other micro-organisms in the ecosystem. Thus the energy enters ecosystem through the process of photosynthesis and is transferred to the living organisms.<b> <q>Thus, natural ecosystem supports life on earth</b></q>.</p>
